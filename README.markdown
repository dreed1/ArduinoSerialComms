#Arduino Serial Comms (with python!)

This repo contains the arduino sketch to run a physical button and connect it to your computer through the serial port. This allows for some pretty creative opportunities, I want to use it to have a one button deploy process for our server but you could make some footswitch or maybe a 'my boss is watching me' button... the possibilities are endless.
